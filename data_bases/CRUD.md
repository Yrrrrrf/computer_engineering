# Create Read Update Delete
The **CRUD** functions can be called by users to perform different types of operations on selected data within the [[data bases|database]]. This could be accomplished using code or through a graphical user interface.

### Create
 Allows users to create a new record in the database. In the [[structured query language|SQL]] [[relational data bases|relational database]] application, the **Create** function is called INSERT. A user can create a new row and populate it with data that corresponds to each attribute, but only an administrator might be able to add new attributes to the table itself.

### Read
Is similar to a search function. It allows users to search and retrieve specific records in the table and read their values. Users may be able to find desired records using keywords, or by filtering the data based on customized criteria.

### Update
Is used to modify existing records that exist in the [[data bases|database]]. To fully change a record, users may have to modify information in multiple fields. As a result, the existing record in the database must be changed and all of the attribute values changed to reflect the characteristics of the new data. In both SQL the update function is simply called UPDATE.

### Delete
 Allows users to remove records from a [[data bases|database]] that is no longer needed. Some [[relational data bases|relational database]] applications may permit users to perform either a hard delete or a soft delete. A hard delete permanently removes records from the database, while a soft delete might simply update the status of a row to indicate that it has been deleted while leaving the data present and intact.
