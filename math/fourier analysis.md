# Fourier Analysis

## Fourier Series

### Definition
A function $f(x)$ can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal functions, each with a different frequency and amplitude. This is called a Fourier series.

### Fourier Series of a Square Wave
The Fourier series of a square wave is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \sin(nx)
$$
