# Fourier Analysis

## Fourier Series

### Definition
A function $f(x)$ can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal functions, each with a different frequency and amplitude. This is called a Fourier series.

### Fourier Series of a Square Wave

$$
f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \sin(nx)
$$

### Descrete Fourier Transform
Is probably the most important tool in signal processing. It is used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequencies. It is also used to reconstruct a signal from its frequency components.
