# [Probability](probability.ipynb)

Is the branch of mathematics that deals with the **analysis of random phenomena**. It is used to calculate the likelihood that an event will occur or not occur.

Is an essential part of [statistics](./../statistics/statistics.md). It is used to calculate the **probability** of an event occurring.
