# [Statistics](statistics.ipynb)

Is the branch of mathematics that deals with the **collection, organization, summarization, and interpretation of data**. It is used to make decisions based on data.

## Index

### [Probability](../probability/probability.md)
Is the branch of mathematics that deals with the **analysis of random phenomena**. It is used to calculate the likelihood that an event will occur or not occur.

#### [basic concepts](../probability/probability.ipynb)
- population and sample
- independent events
- conditional probability
- bayes' theorem

#### [distributions](../probability/probability_distributions.ipynb)
- mass and density functions
- [discrete distributions](../probability/discrete_distributions.ipynb)
- [continuous distributions](../probability/continuous_distributions.ipynb)
- [joint distributions](../probability/joint_distributions.ipynb)


### [Descriptive Statistics](descriptive_statistics.ipynb)
Is a branch of **statistics** that deals with the collection, organization, summarization, and interpreting information about the data or a sample of individuals or items.
Is used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. It also helps to find out if the data collected represent the entire population or sample.

#### Univariant Data
- group data (frequency and interval data)
- percentiles (percentile, quartile, decile, percentile rank)
- asymmetry (pearson's moment coefficient of skewness and kurtosis)
- measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)


#### [Bivariant Data](bivariant_data.ipynb)
- Cross-tabulations, contingency tables and representation via scatterplots
- correlation (pearson's correlation coefficient, spearman's rank correlation coefficient, kendall's tau coefficient)
- regression (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression)
- Quantitative measures of dependence (covariance, correlation coefficient)

### [Inferential Statistics](inferential_statistics.ipynb)
Deals with the analysis of data that is used to make inferences about a population. It is used to make decisions about the population based on the sample data.

#### [Point Estimation](point_estimation.ipynb)
- mean estimation
- proportion estimation
- variance and quasi-variance estimation
- standard deviation estimation
- moment method and maximum likelihood estimation

#### [Confidence Intervals](confidence_intervals.ipynb)
- mean estimation (poblational and sample)
- proportion estimation (poblational and sample)
- variance and quasi-variance estimation
- mean, variance and proportion difference estimation
- standard deviation estimation

#### [Hypothesis Testing](hypothesis_testing.ipynb)
- bilateral and unilateral hypothesis
