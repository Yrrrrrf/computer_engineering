# Discrete math

Is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It is the foundation of [[computer science]] and related fields.

## What is a discrete math?
- [[graph]]
- [[trees]]
- [[heap]]

Is a consecuent of a set of elements that are connected between them. It uses the bases of [[logic]] and algebra.


## [[truth tables|Truth Tables]]

A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic, specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, propositional calculus and predicate calculus. It is a type of table used to evaluate the validity of a statement in a formal system, such as a logic or a set theory. Each row of the table represents a possible interpretation of the statement, and each column represents a possible value of the statement's logical variables.

## [[propositional logic|Propositional Logic]]

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying propositions to form more complex propositions. A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both at the same time. A proposition can be expressed in natural language, or in a formal language such as propositional logic.

## [[predicate logic|Predicate Logic]]

Predicate logic is a branch of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying propositions to form more complex propositions. A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both at the same time. A proposition can be expressed in natural language, or in a formal language such as propositional logic.
