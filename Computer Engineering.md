# Computer Engineering

Branch of electronical engineering that deals with the [[design]] and implementation of computer systems and [[computer science]].

It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), [[robotics]], [[computer network|computer networks]], [[computer architecture]] and [[operating system]]. Computer engineers are involved in many [[hardware]] and [[software]] aspects of computing, from the design of individual [[microprocessor]]s, [[personal computer|personal computers]], [[supercomputer|supercomputers]], to circuit design. 


### Computer Science

Is the study of the **theoretical foundations of information and computation**, and of practical techniques for their implementation and application in computer systems. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information.
