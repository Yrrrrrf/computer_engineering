    "# Operators\n",
    "They are used to perform operations on variables and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:\n",
    "- Addition: `+`  (also used for string concatenation)\n",
    "- Subtraction: `-`  \n",
    "- Multiplication: `*`\n",
    "- Division: `/`\n",
    "- Modulus: `%`  (remainder of division)\n",
    "- Exponentiation: `**`  (power of)\n",
    "- Floor division: `//`  (division rounded down to the nearest integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Operators\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
    "- `and`  Returns True if both statements are true\n",
    "- `or`  Returns True if one of the statements is true\n",
    "- `not`  Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values:\n",
    "- `==`  Returns True if the values are equal\n",
    "- `!=`  Returns True if the values are not equal\n",
    "- `>`  Returns True if the left value is greater than the right value\n",
    "- `<`  Returns True if the left value is less than the right value\n",
    "- `>=`  Returns True if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value\n",
    "- `<=`  Returns True if the left value is less than or equal to the right value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Operators\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:\n",
    "- `=`  Assigns values from the right side operands to the left side operand\n",
    "- `+=`  Add AND\n",
    "- `-=`  Subtract AND\n",
    "- `*=`  Multiply AND\n",
    "- `/=`  Divide AND\n",
    "- `%=`  Modulus AND\n",
    "- `**=`  Exponent AND\n",
    "- `//=`  Floor Division\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identity Operators\n",
    "Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:\n",
    "- `is`  Returns True if both variables are the same object\n",
    "- `is not`  Returns True if both variables are not the same object\n",
    "\n",
    "## Membership Operators\n",
    "Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:\n",
    "- `in`  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object\n",
    "- `not in`  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitwise Operators\n",
    "Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:\n",
    "- `&`  AND\n",
    "- `|`  OR\n",
    "- `^`  XOR\n",
    "- `~`  NOT\n",
    "- `<<`  Zero fill left shift\n",
    "- `>>`  Signed right shift\n",
    "\n"
