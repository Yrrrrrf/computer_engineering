# [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Beautiful Soup is a [[python|Python]] library for **pulling data out of [[html|HTML]] and XML files**. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

Beautiful Soup 4 is fast, lenient, and forgiving. It doesn’t care if your markup is invalid or incomplete. It does its best to give you what you want, and to ignore what you don’t want.

## Installation
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
