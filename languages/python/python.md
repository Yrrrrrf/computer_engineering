### Garbage Collector
Python uses a reference counting system to track the memory usage of objects. When an object is created, it is assigned a reference count of zero. When an object is referenced by another object, the reference count of the object is incremented by one. When an object is no longer referenced by another object, the reference count of the object is decremented by one. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the object is deallocated.
