# Computer Graphics

Is the study of **digital visual content**, and the techniques used to create and process visual content. It is a subfield of [[computer science]] and is closely related to [[computer vision]], [[geometry|computational geometry]], and computer animation.

## [[2D graphics]]
- pixel graphics
- vector graphics
- raster graphics
- generative [[machine learning]] models

## [[3D graphics]]
Usually, 3D graphics refers to computer graphics that use a 3D representation of geometric data (often Cartesian) that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. Such images may be for later display on a 2D screen, a 3D screen, or a printed page.

## [[plotting]]
Is the act of drawing a graph or diagram that **represents the relationship between variables**.

## [[modeling]]
Is the process of creating a mathematical representation of a real-world object or concept. It is a key component of computer graphics, computer-aided design, and computer-aided manufacturing.

## [[animation]]
Is the process of creating the illusion of motion and shape change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of static images that minimally differ from each other.
