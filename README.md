# Computer Engineering

This repository is a collection of concepts, algorithms, and data structures that I have been learning in my Computer Engineering degree.
I have tried to make the **code as simple as possible**, and I have tried to explain the concepts as best as I can.

I hope this repository can help you in your studies.
