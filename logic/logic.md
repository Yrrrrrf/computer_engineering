# Logic

Logic is the study of the principles of reasoning. It is a formal discipline that is used to evaluate arguments and to draw conclusions from premises. Logic is a fundamental part of mathematics, and is also used in computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

## [[logic gates|Logic Gates]]

A logic gate is an electronic circuit that implements a Boolean function. It has one or more inputs and one or more outputs. The output of a logic gate is determined by the input values. The output of a logic gate is either 1 or 0, which is called a bit. A logic gate can be used to build more complex circuits.

## Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values `true` and `false`, usually denoted `1` and `0` respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers and the main operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction (denoted `∧`), the disjunction (denoted `∨`), and the negation (denoted `¬`).

## [[discrete math]]

Discrete math is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It is the foundation of computer science and related fields.
