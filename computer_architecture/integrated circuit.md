# Integrated Circuit (IC)

Sometimes called a **chip** or **microchip**, is a [[semiconductor]] wafer on which thousands or millions of tiny *[[resistors]]*, [[capacitors]], and [[transistor|transistors]] are fabricated.

The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's high degree of integration, reliability, and low cost have made it the dominant form of electronic circuitry in modern electronic systems.

The IC's many components are interconnected to perform a specific function, such as an amplifier, radio receiver, or digital logic circuit


## History
The first integrated circuit design was the [[transistor]]-[[transistor]] [[logic gates|logic]] (TTL) circuit, which was invented in 1958 by **Jack Kilby** and **Robert Noyce** at **Texas Instruments**.

Then in 1961, **Jack Kilby** and **Nobel Prize**-winning physicist **Walter Brattain**.

The [[x86]] architecture was developed by $intel$ in the 1970s and 1980s, and it is the most widely used architecture in the world.

The [[arm]] architecture was developed by **$Advanced\ RISC\ Machines$** in the 1980s and 1990s, and it is the most widely used architecture in mobile devices.

The [[risc-v]] architecture was developed by **RISC-V Foundation** in the 2010s, and it is the most widely used architecture in open-source projects.
