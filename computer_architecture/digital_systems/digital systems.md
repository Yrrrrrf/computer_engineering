[[embedded system]]

# 6th Semester stuff
Everything is based based on HDL (Hardware Description Language) and VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) is the most popular one.

1 Development of Digital Systems (HDL)
- concepts of digital systems
- languages (VHDL, Verilog)

2 combinational logic synthesis
- combinational & sequential logic
- multiplexers & demultiplexers
- decoders & encoders
- magnitude comparators
- adders & subtractors
- shifters & counters
- signal propagation
- memory elements & memory devices (data storage)
- registers, flip-flops, latches

3 sequential logic synthesis
- state machines
- finite state machines
- Moore & Mealy machines
- state diagrams

4 asynchronous state machines
- pwm (pulse width modulation) & frequency modulation
- keyboard & mouse input
- graphic output
