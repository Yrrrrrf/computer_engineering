# Hardware

Includes the **physical parts of a computer**, such as, [[cpu|CPU]], [[random access memory|RAM]], [[memory]], mouse, keyboard, [[storage|computer data storage]], [[gpu|GPU]], sound card, speakers and [[motherboard]].
By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.

The template for all modern computers is the [[Von Neumann architecture]], detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.[3] The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system
