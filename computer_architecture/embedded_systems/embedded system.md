# Embedded Systems

Are computer systems that are designed to **perform a specific task**. They are usually small, low power, and low cost.

They are used in a wide variety of applications, including industrial control systems, medical devices, and consumer electronics. Are often used in applications where a computer system would be too expensive or too large.

### [[rasberry pi|Raspberry Pi]]
Is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to **promote the teaching of basic computer science** in schools and in developing countries. The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as [[robotics]]. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity organisation dedicated to promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.

### [[arduino|Arduino]]
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
