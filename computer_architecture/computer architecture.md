# Computer Architecture

Includes the **physical parts of a computer**, such as, [[cpu|CPU]], [[random access memory|RAM]], [[memory]], mouse, keyboard, [[storage|computer data storage]], [[gpu|GPU]], sound card, speakers and [[motherboard]].
By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. 


### [[Von Neumann]] architecture
The template for all modern computers is the [[Von Neumann architecture]], detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.[3] The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system

Is a computer architecture that uses a single memory space to store both code and data. It is also called the **stored program architecture**.

The **central processing unit (CPU)** is the part of the computer that executes the instructions of a computer program. It is also called the **processor**.

The **memory** is the part of the computer that stores the instructions and data of a program while it is running.

The **input/output (I/O)** is the part of the computer that communicates with the outside world.

The **control unit** is the part of the computer that controls the execution of the instructions.

The **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)** is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical operations.
