### Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

Is a model for improving the capability of an organization to develop, deliver, and maintain software and systems.

**Evaluates a process in terms of it's maturity level**, which is a measure of the process's capability to meet the needs of the organization and its customers.
- 0. *Incomplete: no process (`continuous cmmi`)
- 1. Initial: ad hoc, no process
- 2. Repeatable: process is defined and documented
- 3. Defined: process is managed and measured
- 4. Managed: process is optimized and controlled
- 5. Optimizing: process is monitored and improved
