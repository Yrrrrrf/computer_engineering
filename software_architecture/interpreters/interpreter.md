# [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))

Is a [[software]] that executes instructions written in a [[programming language]] (**source language**), without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

Is a computer program that directly **executes instructions written in a [[programming language|programming]] or [[script language|scripting language]]**, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

1. Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
2. Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and immediately execute that;
3. Explicitly execute stored precompiled bytecode made by a [[compilers]] and matched with the interpreter [[virtual machine|Virtual Machine]].
