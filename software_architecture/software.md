# Software

Is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Software can be divided into two main categories: system software and application software.
Is the software that runs on a computer and **manages the [[hardware]]** and other [[software resources]]. It is also called the [[operating system]] (OS).

# Software Architecture

Is the process of defining the structure, components, and other characteristics of a $software$ system to **achieve specific goals** in its environment.
Architects **separate architecture characteristics into broad categories depending upon operation**, rarely appearing requirements, structure etc. Below some important characteristics which are commonly considered are explained.

## [[project management|Project Management]]
Is the process of planning, organizing, and managing resources to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectives.

## Process of Software Architecture
1. $Planning$ - defining the **scope of the project**, the **work to be done**, and the **resources required** to complete the project.
2. $Analysis$ - **examining the requirements of the project** and the resources available to determine the best way to complete the project.
3. $Design$ - **creating a detailed plan** for the project.
4. $Implementation$ - **building the project**.
5. $Testing$ - **evaluating the project to ensure** that it **meets the requirements and works as expected**.
6. $Maintenance$*(additional)* - **updating and improving the project** after it has been completed.

| Operational | Structural | Cross-Cutting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Availability, performance, relaiability, low fault tolerance, scalability | Configurability, extensibility, supportability, maintainability, portability | Accessibility, security, usability,  privacy, feasibility |

## SOLID principles of Software architecture
- **S**ingle Responsibility – Each services should have a single objective.
- **O**pen-Closed Principle – Software modules should be independent and expandable.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle – Independent services should be able to communicate and substitute each other.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle – Software should be divided into such microservices there should not be any redundancies.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle – Higher-levels modules should not be depending on low-lower-level modules and changes in higher level will not affect to lower level.

## [[architecture pattern|Architecture Pattern]]

Is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

### [[clean architecture]]


## [[design patterns|Design Patterns]]

Is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

## [[testing|Software Testing]]

It is a practice that help us to check if the $project$ that we are developing works properly, if it doesn't we have done some changes that are changes our $project$ behavior.
