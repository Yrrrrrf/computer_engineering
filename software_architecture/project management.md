# [Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management)

Is the process of planning, organizing, and managing resources to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectives.

The easiest way to manage the changes in a project is using a **version control system** such as [[git]]. But it's also possible to use a **project management tool** such as [jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [trello](https://trello.com/).

Another way is use [[cookiecutter]] to create a template for the project.

## main directories
```bash
project_management/
├───src/ # source code
│   └───main.cpp  # main file of the project (entry point)
├───tests/  # tests
├───resources/  # resources (images, sounds, etc.)
├───requirements/  # requirements (dependencies)
├───readme.md  # readme (description of the project)
├───license.md  # license (MIT, GPL, etc.)
```
