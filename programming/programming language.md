# Languages

Is a formal language, that is used to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express [[algorithms]] using [[logic]].

A same language can support many [[programming paradigms]].

### Compilation vs Interpretation
Count witt a defined sintaxis, an static semantic & a semantic.
- Sintaxis/Grammatic
	- Define a sequense of symbols is correct.
- Static Semantic
	- Define sentences with a correct sintaxis.
- Semantic
	- Defines de meaning, in any langauge, **the meaning is unique**.


### Clasification
Lvl
- High - Optimized to human read
- Low - Optimized to machine
Porpuse
- General - Implements all the [[turing machine#Primitives|primitive data types]] needed to implement any algorithm
- specific domain - Created to one specific application
Run
- Interpretated - Traduce it in run time
- Compiled - Traduce it before run it.


# [[script language|Script Language]]

A script language is a programming language that is interpreted rather than compiled. It is usually used for small programs that are run only once. It is also used for programs that are run many times, but are not large enough to justify the time and effort required to compile them.
* **Interpreted** - The script is interpreted by a program called an interpreter. The interpreter reads the script and executes it. The interpreter is usually a program that is separate from the script. The interpreter is usually written in a compiled language such as C or C++.

* **Embedded** - The script is embedded in a program. The program reads the script and executes it. The script is usually written in a compiled language such as C or C++.
* **[[bash|Bash]]** - A shell script language that is used in the Linux operating system.

* **[[Python]]** - A general purpose programming language that is used for web development, data science, and machine learning.

[[javascript|JavaScript]] is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. It is used to add dynamic effects to web pages. It is also used to validate forms and to create cookies.
