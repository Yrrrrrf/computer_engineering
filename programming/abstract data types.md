# Abstract Data Types
 
Represents a particular set of behaviors, not their implementation.
So it's possible to built [[abstract data types|ADTs]] using [[turing machine|primitive data types.]]

### List
Can contains an [array] of a same datatype written in sequaential order.

### Stack
- Behavior: LIFO (Last In Fist Out)
![[stack.webp]]
### Queue
- Behavior: First In First Out
The nearest value to get out is named **front** & the furthest away is named **rear**
![[queue.webp]]
### Priority Queue
- Behavior: 

### Dictionary
- Behavior: 

### [[graph|Graph]]
- Behavior: 

### [[trees]]
- Behavior: 

### Linked List
Is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:
![[linked_list.png]]
Each node **stores a piece of data and a reference to its next and/or previous node**. This builds a linear sequence of nodes. All Linked Lists store a **_head,_** which is a reference to the first node. Some Linked Lists also store a **tail**, a reference to the last node in the list.
