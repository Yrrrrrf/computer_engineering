## [Primitive Data Types](https://snipcademy.com/python-primitive-data-types#strings-methods)

Are a set of **basic data types** from which all other data types are constructed. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.

Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use.

### Data Types
- booleans
- numbers
	- integers
	- longs
	- floats
	- complex
