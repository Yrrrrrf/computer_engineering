# Data Types

## [Primitive Data Types](Turing%20Machine.md#primitive-data-types)
Are a set of **basic data types** from which all other data types are constructed. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- boolean
- integer
- float
- char -> string

Data types can be classified in different ways:
- hex (`0xff`)  # 255
- octal (`0o77`)  # 63
- binary (`0b11111111`)  # 255

## Structured Data Types
Are a set of **complex data types** that are constructed from primitive data types. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- array, list, vector
- data base

## Semi-Structured Data Types
Are a set of **complex data types** that are constructed from primitive data types. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- json, xml (extensible markup language)
- csv, tsv (tab separated values)

## Unstructured Data Types
Are a set of **complex data types** that are constructed from primitive data types. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- text, image, audio, video
- cientific data
- html
- cv

## Cualitative vs Quantitative Data Types
Are a set of **complex data types** that are constructed from primitive data types. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- Cualitative
    - Nominal
    - Ordinal
- Quantitative
    - Discrete
    - Continuous

## Historical Data Types
Are a set of **complex data types** that are constructed from primitive data types. They are the most basic building blocks of programming & all they are necessary to get a **complete turing machine**.
- date, time
