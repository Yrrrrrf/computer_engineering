# Control Structures
Are just a way to specify flow of control in programs. Any [[algorithms|algorithm]] or program can be more clear and understood if they use **self-contained modules called as logic or control structures**. It basically analyzes and chooses in which direction a program flows based on certain parameters or conditions. There are three basic types of logic, or flow of control, known as:
1.  Sequence logic, or sequential flow
2.  Selection logic, or conditional flow
3.  Iteration logic, or repetitive flow

### Sequential Logic (Sequential Flow)

As the name suggests follows a serial or sequential flow in which the flow depends on the **series of instructions given to the computer**. Unless new instructions are given, the modules are executed in the obvious sequence. The sequences may be given, by means of numbered steps explicitly. Also, implicitly follows the order in which modules are written. Most of the processing, even some complex problems, will generally follow this elementary flow pattern.

### Selection Logic (Conditional Flow)

Selection Logic simply involves a number of conditions or parameters which decides one out of several written modules. The structures which use these type of logic are known asÂ **Conditional Structures**. These structures can be of three types:
- if
- else if

### Iteration Logic (Repetitive Flow)  
The Iteration logic employs a loop which involves a repeat statement followed by a module known as the body of a loop
- for
- while
