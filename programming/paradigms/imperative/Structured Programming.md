# Structured Programming

Is a **simplified form** of [[programming paradigms#Imperative Programming|imperative programming]]. The crucial difference from the basic principle is that instead of absolute jump commands (instructions that lead to processing continuing at another point instead of the next command), this software programming paradigm makes use of **[[control structures|control loops and structures]]**. An example is the use of “**do...while**”, which executes an instruction automatically for as long as a particular condition is true (at least once).
