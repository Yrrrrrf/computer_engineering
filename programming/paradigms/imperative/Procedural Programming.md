# Procedural Programming
The procedural programming paradigm extends the imperative approach with the possibility of **dividing algorithms into more manageable sections**. Depending on the programming language, these are referred to as sub-programs, routines, or functions. The purpose of this division is to make the **programming code clearer** and to **prevent unnecessary code repetitions**.Because of the abstraction of algorithms, the procedural software paradigm represents a crucial step from simple assembly languages towards more complex high-level languages.

This paradigm is very similar to the [[object oriented programming|OOP]]. They've some really similar stuff, like:
