# Concurrent Programming

 In this [[programming paradigms|paradigm]] **several computations are executed concurrently**—during overlapping time periods—instead of sequentially—_with one completing before the next starts.

This is a property of a system—whether a program], computer, or a [[network]]—where there is a separate execution point or [[threads|thread of control]] for each process. In a _concurrent system_ computation can advance without waiting for all other computations to complete.

Is a form of [[modular programming|modular programming]]. In its [[programming paradigms|paradigm]] an overall computation is [factored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science) "Decomposition (computer science)") into subcomputations that may be executed concurrently.
