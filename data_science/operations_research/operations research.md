# [Operations Research](operations_research.ipynb)

Is the application of advanced **analytical methods** ([[numerical analysis]], [[linear algebra]], etc) to help make better decisions.

Frecuently uses mathematical optimization techniques, **linear programming**, **dynamic programming**, and **decision analysis** to arrive at an optimal or near-optimal solution.

Operations research is a subset of [[data science]], statistics, and operations research.
