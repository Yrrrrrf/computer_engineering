# Artifitial Intelligence

Is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of AI because it is a way to make a computer, a learning machine, carry out a specific task.

### What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep [[graph]] with multiple processing layers between the input and output. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning because it is a way to make a machine learning algorithm more accurate.

### What is the difference between AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
AI is the study of how to make a computer, a learning machine, carry out a specific task. Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers between the input and output.

### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data.

### What is the difference between classification and regression?
Classification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a discrete value. Regression is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value.

### What is the difference between a decision tree and a random forest?
A decision tree is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a discrete value. A random forest is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a discrete value. A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees.

### What is the difference between a neural network and a deep neural network?
A neural network is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A deep neural network is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A deep neural network is a neural network with multiple hidden layers.

### What is the difference between a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network?
A convolutional neural network is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A recurrent neural network is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A recurrent neural network is a neural network with a feedback loop.

### What is the difference between a generative adversarial network and a reinforcement learning algorithm?
A generative adversarial network is a type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A reinforcement learning algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous value. A reinforcement learning algorithm is a neural network with a feedback loop.
