# Artifitial Intelligence

Is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include **expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision**. I uses [data science](../data%20science.md) to train the AI model that can solve a determinated problem.

## [Machine Learning](machine%20learning.md)
Is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

## [Deep Learning](deep%20learning.md)
Is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of **learning unsupervised** from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
