# Artifitial Intelligence

Is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of AI because it is a way to make a computer, a learning machine, carry out a specific task.

### What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep [[graph]] with multiple processing layers between the input and output. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning because it is a way to make a machine learning algorithm more accurate.

### What is the difference between AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
AI is the study of how to make a computer, a learning machine, carry out a specific task. Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers between the input and output.
