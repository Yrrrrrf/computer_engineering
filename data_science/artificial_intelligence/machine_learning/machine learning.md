# Machine Learning

Is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that $learn$, that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of [[artificial intelligence]].

Machine learning [[algorithms]] **build a model based on sample data**, known as **training data**, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so, these  [[algorithms]] are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and [[computer vision]], where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

Some implementations of machine learning use data and [[neural networks]] in a way that mimics the working of a **biological brain**. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as **predictive analytics**.
