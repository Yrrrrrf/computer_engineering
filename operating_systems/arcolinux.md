# [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/)

Is a [linux](linux.md) distribution **based on Arch Linux**. It is a rolling release distribution, which means that it is always up to date.

It is a very good option for those who want to learn Arch Linux, but do not want to spend time configuring the system.
